# Hotel Booking Website

A responsive hotel-booking web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Browse hotels, view details by city, and navigate across pages — all from a static site.

## 🌐 Live Demo

You can view the deployed site here:  
[https://saivarmapothuri.github.io/Hotel_Booking_Website/](https://saivarmapothuri.github.io/Hotel_Booking_Website/)

## 🛠 Technologies & Structure

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Static site architecture — no backend required  
- City-specific pages (e.g. `anantapur.html`, `vizag.html`)  
- CSS styling and basic JavaScript for interaction  
- Assets: images, CSS, JS files  


## 🚀 How to Run Locally

Since this is a static site, you can view it by opening the HTML files in your browser. No server setup is needed.
